## AWT & Swing Programming

*(BCA – Tribhuvan University | Examination Notes)*


## 1. Introduction to AWT and Swing

### 1.1 AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)

**AWT** is Java’s **first GUI toolkit** used to develop window-based applications.

### Key Characteristics of AWT

* Heavyweight components
* Platform dependent
* Uses native OS components
* Faster but limited flexibility

### Example AWT Components

* Button
* Label
* TextField
* Frame


### 1.2 Swing

**Swing** is an **advanced GUI toolkit** built on top of AWT.

### Key Characteristics of Swing

* Lightweight components
* Platform independent
* Written entirely in Java
* Supports **MVC architecture**
* Rich set of components

### Swing Package

```java
javax.swing.*
```


## 2. JFrame (Top-Level Container)

### Definition

**JFrame** is a **top-level window** in Swing used to contain other components.

### Characteristics

* Has title bar
* Can be resized
* Supports menus

### Example

```java
import javax.swing.*;

public class MyFrame {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    JFrame f = new JFrame("My First Frame");
    f.setSize(300, 200);
    f.setVisible(true);
    f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
  }
}
```


## 3. Swing Components

### 3.1 JLabel

**JLabel** is used to display **text or image**.

```java
JLabel lbl = new JLabel("Welcome to Swing");
```

### 3.2 JTextField

**JTextField** is used to take **single-line text input**.

```java
JTextField txt = new JTextField(15);
```


### 3.3 JButton

**JButton** is a **clickable button**.

```java
JButton btn = new JButton("Submit");
```


## 4. Event Handling in Swing
Event Handling is the mechanism that controls the event and decides what should happen if an event occurs. This mechanism has a code which is known as an event handler, that is executed when an event occurs.

Java uses the Delegation Event Model to handle the events. This model defines the standard mechanism to generate and handle the events.

The Delegation Event Model has the following key participants.
**Source** − The source is an object on which the event occurs. Source is responsible for providing information of the occurred event to it's handler. Java provide us with classes for the source object.

**Listener** − It is also known as event handler. The listener is responsible for generating a response to an event. From the point of view of Java implementation, the listener is also an object. The listener waits till it receives an event. Once the event is received, the listener processes the event and then returns.

The benefit of this approach is that the user interface logic is completely separated from the logic that generates the event. The user interface element is able to delegate the processing of an event to a separate piece of code.

In this model, the listener needs to be registered with the source object so that the listener can receive the event notification. This is an efficient way of handling the event because the event notifications are sent only to those listeners who want to receive them.

### Steps Involved in Event Handling
- Step 1 − The user clicks the button and the event is generated.

- Step 2 − The object of concerned event class is created automatically and information about the source and the event get populated within the same object.

- Step 3 − Event object is forwarded to the method of the registered listener class.

- Step 4 − The method is gets executed and returns.

### Common Events

1	AWTEvent : It is the root event class for all SWING events. This class and its subclasses supercede the original `java.awt.Event` class.

2	ActionEvent : The ActionEvent is generated when the button is clicked or the item of a list is double-clicked.

3	InputEvent : The InputEvent class is the root event class for all component-level input events.

4	KeyEvent : On entering the character the Key event is generated.

5	MouseEvent : This event indicates a mouse action occurred in a component.

6	WindowEvent : The object of this class represents the change in the state of a window.

### ActionListener Example

```java
btn.addActionListener(e -> {
  System.out.println("Button Clicked");
});
```

## 5. Layout Management

A **layout manager** controls the **position and size** of components in a container.


### 5.1 FlowLayout

* Default layout
* Components arranged left to right

```java
setLayout(new FlowLayout());
```


### 5.2 BorderLayout

Divides container into **five regions**:

* North
* South
* East
* West
* Center

```java
setLayout(new BorderLayout());
add(btn, BorderLayout.NORTH);
```


### 5.3 GridLayout

Arranges components in **rows and columns**.

```java
setLayout(new GridLayout(2,2));
```


## 6. JPanel

**JPanel** is a **container used to group components**.

### Importance

* Helps organize GUI
* Supports nested layouts

```java
JPanel p = new JPanel();
p.add(new JButton("OK"));
```


## 7. Choice Components


### 7.1 JCheckBox

Allows **multiple selections**.

```java
JCheckBox cb = new JCheckBox("Java");
```


### 7.2 JRadioButton

Allows **single selection** (used with ButtonGroup).

```java
JRadioButton r1 = new JRadioButton("Male");
JRadioButton r2 = new JRadioButton("Female");
ButtonGroup bg = new ButtonGroup();
bg.add(r1);
bg.add(r2);
```


## 8. Borders in Swing


Borders enhance the **appearance of components**.

### Example

```java
panel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createTitledBorder("Details"));
```


## 9. JComboBox and Its Events

**JComboBox** provides a **drop-down list**.

```java
JComboBox<String> cb =
 new JComboBox<>(new String[]{"Java","Python"});
```

### Event Handling

```java
cb.addActionListener(e -> {
  System.out.println(cb.getSelectedItem());
});
```


## 10. JList and MVC Pattern

**JList** displays a **list of items**.

```java
String[] data = {"A","B","C"};
JList<String> list = new JList<>(data);
```

### MVC Concept

* **Model** → ListModel
* **View** → JList
* **Controller** → Event listeners


## 11. Key and Mouse Event Handling


### 11.1 Key Events

Handled using `KeyListener`.

```java
txt.addKeyListener(new KeyAdapter() {
  public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
    System.out.println(e.getKeyChar());
  }
});
```


### 11.2 Mouse Events

Handled using `MouseListener`.

```java
btn.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
  public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
    System.out.println("Mouse Clicked");
  }
});
```


## 12. Menus in Swing

### Components

* JMenuBar
* JMenu
* JMenuItem

### Example

```java
JMenuBar mb = new JMenuBar();
JMenu file = new JMenu("File");
JMenuItem exit = new JMenuItem("Exit");

file.add(exit);
mb.add(file);
setJMenuBar(mb);
```


## 13. JTextArea


**JTextArea** allows **multi-line text input**.

```java
JTextArea ta = new JTextArea(5,20);
```


## 14. Dialog Boxes in Swing

### Types

* Message Dialog
* Confirm Dialog
* Input Dialog

### Example

```java
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Saved Successfully");
```


## 15. JTable (Tabular Data Display)

**JTable** is used to display data in **row and column format**.

```java
String[][] data = {{"1","Ram"},{"2","Sita"}};
String[] col = {"ID","Name"};

JTable table = new JTable(data, col);
```


## 16. MDI (Multiple Document Interface)


### JDesktopPane

Acts as a **container for internal frames**.

### JInternalFrame

Acts as **child windows**.

```java
JDesktopPane dp = new JDesktopPane();
JInternalFrame f = new JInternalFrame("Doc", true, true);
dp.add(f);
```


## 17. Using IDEs (NetBeans, JBuilder)

### Advantages

* Drag and Drop UI design
* Automatic code generation
* Faster development
* Error highlighting

### NetBeans

* Most popular for Swing
* GUI Builder (Matisse)


## 18. Adapter Classes

**Adapter classes** provide **empty implementations** of listener interfaces.

### Common Adapter Classes

* KeyAdapter
* MouseAdapter
* WindowAdapter

### Advantage

* No need to implement all methods

```java
addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
  public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
    System.exit(0);
  }
});
```
