# Java Applets

## 1. Definition of Applet

### What is an Applet?

An **Applet** is a **small Java program** that runs **inside a web browser** or **Applet Viewer**.

> An applet is **embedded in an HTML page** and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provided by the browser or Applet Viewer.

### Key Characteristics of Applets

* Runs on **client-side**
* Requires a **browser or Applet Viewer**
* Does not have `main()` method
* Extends the `Applet` or `JApplet` class
* Uses **lifecycle methods** for execution

### Package Used

```java
java.applet.*
java.awt.*
```


## 2. Types of Applets

### 1. Local Applet

* Stored on local computer
* Executed using Applet Viewer

### 2. Remote Applet

* Stored on a web server
* Downloaded and executed by browser


## 3. Applet Class Hierarchy

```

Applet
```


## 4. Applet Lifecycle

### Definition

The **Applet Lifecycle** refers to the **sequence of methods** that are automatically called by the JVM during the execution of an applet.

### Lifecycle Methods

There are **five important lifecycle methods**:


### 4.1 `init()` Method

**Purpose:**

* Called **once** when the applet is loaded
* Used for **initialization**

```java
public void init() {
  // initialization code
}
```


### 4.2 `start()` Method

**Purpose:**

* Called after `init()`
* Called every time the applet becomes active

```java
public void start() {
  // start execution
}
```


### 4.3 `paint(Graphics g)` Method

**Purpose:**

* Used for **drawing text, shapes, images**
* Called automatically when applet needs to repaint

```java
public void paint(Graphics g) {
  g.drawString("Hello Applet", 50, 50);
}
```


### 4.4 `stop()` Method

**Purpose:**

* Called when applet becomes inactive
* Used to stop background tasks

```java
public void stop() {
  // stop execution
}
```


### 4.5 `destroy()` Method

**Purpose:**

* Called when applet is destroyed
* Used for cleanup

```java
public void destroy() {
  // cleanup code
}
```


### Applet Lifecycle Flow (Exam Note)

```
init() → start() → paint()
        ↓
      stop()
        ↓
     destroy()
```


## 5. Building a Simple Applet

### Simple Applet Program

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

/*
<applet code="HelloApplet.class" width="300" height="200">
</applet>
*/

public class HelloApplet extends Applet {

  public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.drawString("Hello BCA Students", 50, 100);
  }
}
```

### Important Points

* No `main()` method
* `paint()` handles output
* HTML comment used for Applet Viewer


## 6. Using Applet Viewer

### What is Applet Viewer?

**Applet Viewer** is a **Java tool** used to run applets **without a browser**.

### Why Applet Viewer is Used?

* Browsers no longer support applets
* Easy testing during development
* Faster execution


### Steps to Run Applet Using Applet Viewer

1. Save Java file (`HelloApplet.java`)
2. Compile:

```bash
javac HelloApplet.java
```

3. Run:

```bash
appletviewer HelloApplet.java
```


## 7. Adding Controls to Applet

### Definition

**Controls** are GUI components used to interact with the user.

### Common Controls Used in Applets

* Button
* Label
* TextField
* Checkbox

### Example: Applet with Button

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.*;

public class ButtonApplet extends Applet {

  Button b;

  public void init() {
    b = new Button("Click Me");
    add(b);
  }
}
```


## 8. Event Handling in Applets (Brief)

Applets use **event listeners** to handle user actions.

Example:

```java
b.addActionListener(e -> {
  System.out.println("Button Clicked");
});
```


## 9. Animation Concepts in Applet

### Definition of Animation

**Animation** is the technique of displaying **moving graphics** by repeatedly changing the display over time.


## 10. Animation in Applets

### Concept Used

* Graphics redraw
* Thread or timer
* Repeated repainting


### Simple Animation Example

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.*;

public class AnimationApplet extends Applet {

  int x = 0;

  public void paint(Graphics g) {
    g.fillOval(x, 50, 30, 30);
    x = x + 5;

    try {
      Thread.sleep(100);
    } catch(Exception e) {}

    repaint();
  }
}
```

### Explanation

* Circle moves horizontally
* `repaint()` redraws graphics
* `Thread.sleep()` controls speed


## 11. Advantages of Applets

* Platform independent
* Secure execution
* Interactive applications
* Easy deployment (earlier)


## 12. Limitations of Applets

* Browser support discontinued
* Slower startup
* Security restrictions
* Obsolete technology

## Summary

* Applet is a client-side Java program
* Lifecycle methods control execution
* Applet Viewer is used to run applets
* Controls enable interaction
* Animation achieved using repainting
* Applets are legacy but exam-relevant
